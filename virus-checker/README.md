# Virus Checker
A Powercord plugin which adds a button to check if a file contains malicious software.

### Usage
As this plugin implements virus checking through [Hybrid-Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/), an API key registered through their website is needed.

This is simple to get! All you need to do is sign up for an account. Read [this guide](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/knowledge-base/issuing-self-signed-api-key) for further instructions.

After you have acquired your API key, head to your user settings and navigate to Virus Checker's settings panel. Paste your key there, and try the plugin out, if it still errors with a "No token" toast, you might need to reload Discord.

To use the plugin, simply find a message with a file attachment and click the "shield" button.
