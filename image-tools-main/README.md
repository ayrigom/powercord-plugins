A [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) plugin that adds new features to images

## Features
- Lens in a modal image viewport
- Open image as modal in most context menus
- Copy image / link to image
- Save Image As
- Reverse image search
- Color capture

## Known issues
- No support for basic SVG information (Native emoji)
    - The server does not send the file size


### TODO
- Rotate the image
- Gallery mode (deferred to "v3", the likelihood of a more convenient tool for a better result)
