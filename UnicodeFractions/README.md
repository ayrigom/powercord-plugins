This is pretty much what it does. It converts your normal fractions into unicode ones. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

### Description
This is a simple Powercord plugin designed to create Unicode fractions. There is only a few fractions built-in to the Unicode standard, which are very limited. This plugin will automatically create fractions using superscript & subscript characters.

Most maths stuff is taken from random codes in stackoverflow.

If you have any suggestions/ideas, feel free to create an issue, or ping/dm me in Discord (DavidNyan10#8581). Pull requests are very much appreciated.

Also, this is brand new and is my very first powercord plugin, so it might have a few bugs here and there (Nothing seems broken as of right now tho). Feel free to make suggestions and PRs. And not all of the symbols are superscriptable/subscriptable, there are some that I didn't see/didn't know existed. If you see them, feel free to fix them.
